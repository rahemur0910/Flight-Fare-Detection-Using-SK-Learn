# Flight Fare Prediction System ‚úàÔ∏èüí∏

## Project Description

<b>
Flight travel has become a crucial part of modern transportation. With increasing demand and seasonal variations, airfare pricing tends to fluctuate based on various factors such as travel dates, airline, duration, stopovers, and festivals or holiday seasons. This project aims to build an intelligent system that can accurately predict flight fares based on historical and real-time data, thereby assisting travelers in planning more cost-effective journeys.
</b><br><br>

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to develop a web-based system that:

* Predicts flight ticket prices using machine learning algorithms.
* Allows users to input travel details via a web interface.
* Provides real-time fare predictions based on a trained model.
* Offers CSV-based batch prediction support.

<br>

## ML Project Life Cycle

This machine learning application follows the standard lifecycle:

* Data Collection
* Data Exploration and Visualization
* Data Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values, Encoding, etc.)
* Model Building (Regression Techniques using scikit-learn)
* Model Evaluation (using R2 score, MAE, RMSE)
* Model Deployment using Flask & integrated with React.js UI

<br>

## Dataset

We used the "Flight Fare Prediction MH" dataset available on Kaggle. It contains information like airline, date of journey, source, destination, duration, total stops, and price.

### 1. Set up a Virtual Environment:

```bash
conda create -n flightfareenv python=3.8
conda activate flightfareenv
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Flask Server:

```bash
python app.py
```

### 4. Access Application:

Open browser and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

### 5. Usage:

* Fill in flight details on the web form.
* Or upload a CSV file with flight data.
* Click "Predict" to see the fare estimation.
